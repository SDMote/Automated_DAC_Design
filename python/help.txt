Set the TOPOLOGY constant to choose one of the supported topologies: 
0: R2R-ladder DAC

Set the constants for general specifications:
- RESOLUTION:	Number of bits of resolution (2-16 bits)
- MAX_NL:	Target maximum nonlinearity (LSB), for both Integral Non-Linearity (INL) and Differential Non-Linearity (DNL)

Set the constants for topology-dependent specifications:
- R2R-ladder:
	- IDEAL_WIDTH: 1 to use ideal ratio for PMOS and NMOS on-resistances, or 0 to use equall on-resistances for both devices
	- RES_NUMBER
